## Questions

### 1. Understand Their Setup
> "How many apps or platforms does your school use to communicate with you?"

> "Walk me through what happens when your school sends out information - how do you typically find out about things?"

**Listen for:** Number of apps, email vs text vs app, how overwhelmed they sound

---

### 2. Find the Pain
> "Tell me about the last time you missed something important from school - a deadline, event, or form."

> "How did that make you feel?"

> "How often does that happen?"

**Listen for:** Specific examples, emotional language, frequency

---

### 3. Current Workarounds
> "What do you currently do to stay on top of school communications?"

> "Have you tried any apps or tools to help with this?"

> "What didn't work about them?"

**Listen for:** Manual systems (calendar, reminders), tools tried and abandoned

---

### 4. Magic Wand
> "If you could wave a magic wand and have school communications work perfectly, what would that look like?"

**Listen for:** Specific features they wish existed

---

### 5. Willingness to Pay
> "If an app existed that summarized all school messages, put events on your calendar automatically, and gave you one place for everything - would you use it?"

> "Would you pay for it? What would be a fair monthly price?"

**Listen for:** Enthusiasm level, specific price, hesitation

---

### 6. Test Differentiation
> "There's an app called Ohai that does this for $25/month. Would you pay $8/month for something simpler that just focuses on school?"

> "Would you prefer an app that does everything - groceries, chores, appointments - or one that just handles school stuff really well?"

> "What if instead of downloading an app, you just got a weekly text summarizing your kids' school week?"

> "Would you use something even if other parents at your school weren't using it?"

**Listen for:** Price sensitivity, preference for simplicity vs features, app fatigue
