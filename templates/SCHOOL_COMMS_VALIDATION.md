# School Communications App - Validation Plan

Validating the pain point: Parents overwhelmed by school communication across multiple channels/platforms.

---

## Part 1: Honeycomb Evaluation (2-3 weeks)

### Setup Checklist
- [ ] Download Honeycomb app (iOS or Android)
- [ ] Connect/forward school emails from both kids' schools
- [ ] Set up for 2-3 weeks of real usage

### Daily Tracking

For each school communication you receive, note:

| Date | Source (email/text/app) | Did Honeycomb catch it? | Was summary accurate? | Calendar event created? | What was missing? |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| | | | | | |

### Weekly Reflection Questions

**Week 1:**
- Did I still miss any important dates/events?
- How much time did I spend in Honeycomb vs other apps?
- What information did I still have to manually track?

**Week 2:**
- Am I actually using it daily, or did I forget about it?
- What's frustrating about the experience?
- What's surprisingly good?

**Week 3:**
- Would I pay for this? How much?
- What's still broken/missing?
- Am I less stressed about school communications?

### Evaluation Scorecard

Rate 1-5 after testing:

| Your Need | Honeycomb Score | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Summarized messages | /5 | |
| Auto-extract events to calendar | /5 | |
| Unified inbox (email + text + app) | /5 | |
| Reminders for upcoming events | /5 | |
| Works for multiple kids/schools | /5 | |
| **Overall: Solves my problem?** | /5 | |

### Key Questions to Answer

1. Does Honeycomb handle non-email communications? (texts, ParentSquare notifications)
2. Does it work well with ParentSquare specifically?
3. Is the AI summarization actually useful or generic?
4. Would this work for a parent who's less tech-savvy?

## Part 2: Parent Interviews (5-10 parents)

### Who to Talk To

**Ideal interview subjects:**
- Parents with 2+ kids (more chaos = more pain)
- Parents with kids at different schools (multiplied complexity)
- Working parents (less time to manage info)
- Parents you know complain about "missing things"

**Where to find them:**
- School pickup/dropoff
- Kids' sports/activities
- Parent friends
- Nextdoor/neighborhood groups
- Facebook parent groups (your kids' schools)

### The Ask

> "Hey, I'm exploring an idea for an app and trying to understand how parents deal with school communications. Would you have 15 minutes to chat about your experience? Just trying to learn - not selling anything."

### Interview Questions

**Opening (get them talking):**
1. "How many apps/platforms does your school use to communicate with you?"
2. "Walk me through what happens when your school sends out information - how do you typically find out about things?"

**Dig into the pain:**
3. "Tell me about the last time you missed something important from school - a deadline, event, or form."
4. "How did that make you feel?"
5. "How often does that happen?"

**Understand current behavior:**
6. "What do you currently do to stay on top of school communications?"
7. "Have you tried any apps or tools to help with this?"
8. "What didn't work about them?"

**Magic wand question:**
9. "If you could wave a magic wand and have school communications work perfectly, what would that look like?"

**Validate willingness to pay:**
10. "If an app existed that [summarized all school messages / put events on your calendar automatically / gave you one place for everything] - would you use it?"
11. "Would you pay for it? What would be a fair price?"

### What to Listen For

**Strong pain signals:**
- Emotional language ("I hate...", "It drives me crazy...", "I feel like a bad parent when...")
- Specific recent examples (not vague complaints)
- Workarounds they've built (spreadsheets, reminder systems, asking other parents)
- Time/money already spent on the problem

**Weak signals (be skeptical):**
- "Yeah, that would be nice" (polite but not painful)
- Can't remember a specific time they missed something
- No current workarounds (not painful enough to act)

## Part 4: Decision Framework

After 2-3 weeks, answer these:

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] I found 5+ parents who described this as a real pain point
- [ ] At least 3 parents said they would pay for a solution
- [ ] Honeycomb (or similar) doesn't fully solve the problem
- [ ] I can clearly articulate what's missing from current solutions
- [ ] I'm still excited about this problem after talking to people

### Go / No-Go Criteria

**GO if:**
- 7+ out of 10 parents express genuine frustration (not just "yeah that's annoying")
- Clear gap exists that Honeycomb doesn't fill (especially: multi-channel, ParentSquare integration)
- Multiple parents say they'd pay $5+/month
- You have a clear idea of what to build differently

**NO-GO if:**
- Most parents shrug it off as minor inconvenience
- Honeycomb actually solves the problem well enough
- No one would pay (or only $1-2/month)
- The pain is real but a tech solution isn't wanted

### Pivot Options (if no-go)

If this specific angle doesn't validate, related pivots to consider:
- **Teacher-focused:** Help teachers communicate better (harder to sell to)
- **School admin tool:** Help schools consolidate (long sales cycle)
- **Niche down:** Only sports team communication, only preschool, etc.
- **Different audience:** Divorced/co-parents coordinating school info
