## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `REDDIT_BLUEPRINT.md` | Comprehensive Reddit marketing strategy - warmup, engagement, templates |
| `INDIE_HACKERS_BLUEPRINT.md` | Build-in-public strategy for Indie Hackers community |

| `PROMOTION_GUIDE.md` | Quick reference for daily community engagement |

## How to Use

1. Copy the relevant templates to your project's `docs/marketing/` directory
2. Replace placeholders with your product specifics:
   - `[PRODUCT_NAME]` - Your product name
   - `[YOUR_NICHE]` - Your market/category
   - `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]` - Who you're building for
   - `[YOUR_DIFFERENTIATOR]` - What makes you unique
   - `[COMPETITORS]` - Known alternatives
   - `[TARGET_SUBREDDITS]` - Relevant subreddits for your niche
3. Add product-specific examples and templates
4. Track your learnings in a `USER_FEEDBACK.md` file (not templated - create fresh for each project)

## Key Principles (All Platforms)

1. **90/10 Rule** - 90% genuine value, 10% product mentions
2. **Warmup Period** - Build karma/reputation before any promotion (30+ days)
3. **Answer First** - Help them, then mention your product (if relevant)
4. **No Links** - Let people ask for links, don't drop them
5. **Be Patient** - This takes months, not days

## Customization Checklist

When adapting for a new project:

- [ ] Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` values
- [ ] Add niche-specific subreddits/communities
- [ ] Create product-specific response templates
- [ ] Add your actual differentiators and positioning
- [ ] Remove sections that don't apply to your product
- [ ] Add your own learnings as you engage
