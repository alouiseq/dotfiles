# Community Promotion Guide

A practical quick-reference guide for promoting your product through online communities without getting banned or ignored.

**Customize for your product:** Replace `[PRODUCT_NAME]`, `[YOUR_NICHE]`, `[YOUR_DIFFERENTIATOR]`, and `[COMPETITORS]` with your specifics.

---

## Current Status

Fill these in for your product:

- **Account stage:** Fresh / karma building / established
- **Karma target:** 200-300 before any app mentions
- **Warmup period:** 30 days minimum
- **Product gaps:** [Features users want that you don't have yet]

---

## The Mindset

You're not promoting an app. You're a person who cares about [YOUR_NICHE], helping other people who care about [YOUR_NICHE]. The app is a natural extension of that - not the point.

**The question isn't:** "How do I promote my app?"
**The question is:** "Where do people with this problem gather, and how can I be useful to them?"

---

## Do's

### Engagement
- **Do** respond to existing threads rather than creating new posts
- **Do** ask genuine follow-up questions ("What made you stick with that app?")
- **Do** share your own experience as a user, not as an app builder
- **Do** recommend competitors when they fit - builds trust
- **Do** save threads with engaged users to revisit later

### Content
- **Do** answer their question FIRST, completely
- **Do** use specific language, not generic ("I use X because..." not "[category] apps should...")
- **Do** share opinions on apps you've actually used
- **Do** highlight your advantages naturally when relevant

### Research
- **Do** note what features users mention
- **Do** note what users DON'T mention (may need education)
- **Do** track competitor pain points
- **Do** save posts for when you have the features they want

---

## Don'ts

### Never (Account Risk)
- **Don't** mention your app on a fresh account - 90% ban rate
- **Don't** post "I built this" style content until karma is established
- **Don't** drop links ever (even when you have karma)
- **Don't** create new posts asking "what do you look for in an app" - reads as market research

### Avoid (Bad Impressions)
- **Don't** pitch an app that doesn't solve their stated problem
- **Don't** say "my app doesn't have X yet" - sets expectations you may not meet
- **Don't** be the person who makes every thread about your product
- **Don't** engage just to pitch - people can tell

### Messaging
- **Don't** use builder language ("features," "users," "market")
- **Don't** ask generic questions ("what features matter to you?")
- **Don't** sound like you're doing market research (even if you are)

## Response Templates

### When someone asks about [CATEGORY] apps
```
I use an app - [specific thing you use it for] is what I actually use daily.
[Secondary benefit] is nice but honestly I just want [core need].
```

### When someone asks what you look for
```
[Primary need] (has to be [requirement]), [secondary need] so I'm not
guessing, and [tertiary need]. Everything else is nice-to-have.
```

### When asking follow-up questions
```
Curious - what made you stick with it over other options?
```

```
What's not working about your current setup?
```

```
Do you actually use [feature] or is it more of a nice-to-have?
```

### When recommending alternatives (builds trust)
```
[COMPETITOR] is solid for that - [specific strength]. [Optional: what
they don't do well if relevant to your differentiator].
```

---

## When You CAN Mention [PRODUCT_NAME]

Only when ALL of these are true:

1. ✅ Account has 200-300+ karma
2. ✅ 30+ days of genuine engagement history
3. ✅ The thread is directly relevant
4. ✅ [PRODUCT_NAME] actually solves their stated problem
5. ✅ You've answered their question first
6. ✅ No link - just mention by name if natural

**Format when ready:**
```
I've been using [PRODUCT_NAME] for [specific use case] - [specific thing
you like about it]. [Answer rest of their question or add value].
```

Never lead with the app. Never make it the point.

---

## Positioning Your Differentiators

Use these when positioning (after warmup period):

| Differentiator | How to mention naturally |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| [DIFFERENTIATOR_1] | "[Natural way to describe benefit without marketing speak]" |
| [DIFFERENTIATOR_2] | "[Natural way to describe benefit]" |
| [DIFFERENTIATOR_3] | "[Natural way to describe benefit]" |

**Note:** If users don't ask for your differentiator unprompted, it needs demonstration, not just description. Consider creating a short video/GIF showing it in action.

---

## Current Gaps (Don't Promise These)

List features users want that you don't have:

- ❌ [Gap 1] - [how often it's requested]
- ❌ [Gap 2] - [how often it's requested]
- ❌ [Gap 3] - [how often it's requested]

Don't pitch [PRODUCT_NAME] to users who specifically want these until you have them.

---

## Threads to Revisit

When you build features, come back to these users:

1. **[User/thread description]** - wants [feature]
2. **[User/thread description]** - wants [feature]
3. **[User/thread description]** - wants [feature]

A genuine "hey, I remember you were looking for X - I actually found/built something since we talked" is memorable and not spammy.

---

## Daily Routine

**Time:** 15-30 minutes

1. Check [YOUR_TARGET_SUBREDDITS] for new relevant threads
2. Engage genuinely on 2-3 threads (answer questions, ask follow-ups)
3. Note any insights in your feedback doc
4. Don't force it - skip days when there's nothing relevant

**Weekly:** Review saved threads, update feedback doc, check karma progress.

---

## The Long Game

This isn't a growth hack. It's building a reputation in a community over months.

The goal after 30-60 days:
- People recognize your username
- You have a history of helpful comments
- When you eventually mention your app, it's "oh that person who's always helpful made something" not "another person shilling their app"

Most people can't do this. They spam, get banned, and wonder why Reddit doesn't work. The ones who succeed are patient.

---

## User Feedback Tracking

Keep a running doc of insights from conversations:

### Feature Requests (from real users)
| Feature | Frequency | User quotes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| [Feature] | [How many asked] | "[Exact words they used]" |

### What Users Actually Care About
1. [Need 1] - "[their words]"
2. [Need 2] - "[their words]"
3. [Need 3] - "[their words]"

### What Users Don't Mention
- [Your differentiator they didn't ask for] - needs education

### Competitor Pain Points
| Competitor | Pain Point | Source |
|------------|------------|--------|
| [Competitor] | [What users complain about] | [Thread/user] |
