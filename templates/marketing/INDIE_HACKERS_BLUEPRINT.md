# Indie Hackers Marketing Blueprint

A comprehensive guide for building presence and acquiring users through Indie Hackers using the "Build in Public" strategy.

**Customize for your product:** Replace `[PRODUCT_NAME]`, `[YOUR_NICHE]`, `[YOUR_DIFFERENTIATOR]`, and `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]` with your specifics.

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Build credibility and acquire early users by documenting your journey building [PRODUCT_NAME] on the Indie Hackers community.

**Why Indie Hackers Works:**
- 23% conversion rate per engaged post (vs Product Hunt's 3%)
- Community expects and welcomes product sharing
- Founders actively looking for tools to use
- Long-term relationship building, not one-off launches
- Lower time investment than Twitter (no daily engagement required)

**Time Investment:** 15-30 minutes daily for engagement + 1-2 hours weekly for milestone posts.

**Expected Results:**
- 1,200+ targeted visitors possible in 6 weeks with consistent engagement
- Higher-quality leads (founders = potential power users + word-of-mouth)
- Credibility that compounds over time

## Content Strategy

### The Content Hierarchy (What Performs Best)

| Rank | Content Type | Engagement Level | Example |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| 1 | Success stories with numbers | Highest | "How I got 100 beta users in 2 weeks" |
| 2 | Guides and tutorials | High | "The tech stack I chose (and why)" |
| 3 | Failure stories with lessons | High | "Why my first landing page converted at 0.5%" |
| 4 | Journey updates with metrics | Medium-High | "Week 4: 47 signups, 3 feature requests shipped" |
| 5 | Questions and discussions | Medium | "How do you validate a [NICHE] idea?" |
| 6 | Neutral build stories | Medium | "How I built [FEATURE] in [TECH]" |
| 7 | Product announcements | Lowest | "Check out my new app!" ❌ |

### The 90/10 Rule

Just like Reddit, follow the 90/10 ratio:
- **90%:** Pure value (insights, lessons, answering questions, helping others)
- **10%:** Subtle product mentions when contextually relevant

### Post Templates

**Early Stage (Pre-Revenue):**
```
I'm building [PRODUCT_NAME] that [WHAT_IT_DOES].

Here's why: [PERSONAL_CONNECTION_TO_PROBLEM]

What I'm trying to solve:
- [Problem 1]
- [Problem 2]
- [Problem 3]

Anyone else frustrated with [CURRENT_SOLUTIONS]? What's missing for you?
```

**Technical Deep-Dive:**
```
## How I Built [FEATURE] for [PRODUCT_NAME]

The hardest part wasn't [OBVIOUS_THING] — it was [SURPRISING_CHALLENGE].

Here's what I learned:

### Challenge 1: [CHALLENGE]
[How you solved it]

### Challenge 2: [CHALLENGE]
[How you solved it]

### What I'd Do Differently
[Honest reflection]

Happy to answer questions about the tech stack or approach!
```

**Milestone Update:**
```

- [Metric 3]: [Value]

**What's Working:**
- [Thing that's going well + why]

**What's Not Working:**
- [Challenge you're facing]
- [What you're doing about it]

**This Week's Focus:**
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]

[Question for the community]
```

## Posting Best Practices

### Timing

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Best day | Thursday |
| Best time | Morning US/EU time zones |
| Frequency | 1-2 quality posts per week |
| Milestones | Whenever you hit one (don't force it) |

### Title Formulas That Work

**Questions:**
- "How do you validate [topic]?"
- "What's your approach to [challenge]?"
- "Anyone else struggling with [problem]?"

**Numbers:**
- "How I got [X] users in [Y] time"
- "Week [N]: [Metric] and what I learned"
- "$[Amount] MRR — here's the breakdown"

**Lessons:**
- "What I learned building [thing]"
- "[N] mistakes I made with [topic]"
- "The [adjective] truth about [topic]"

### What NOT to Do

1. ❌ **Pure announcements:** "Check out my new app!" (lowest engagement)
2. ❌ **Vague updates:** "Making progress!" (no specifics = no engagement)
3. ❌ **Wall of text:** Keep it scannable with headers and bullets
4. ❌ **No value:** Always include a lesson, insight, or question
5. ❌ **Ignoring comments:** Reply to everyone — builds reputation
6. ❌ **Spammy frequency:** Quality over quantity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes
1. **Only posting announcements** — Lowest engagement type
2. **No specific numbers** — Vague updates get ignored
3. **Too long without structure** — Use headers and bullets
4. **No lesson or value** — Always include a takeaway
5. **Posting too frequently** — Quality over quantity

### Engagement Mistakes
1. **Not replying to comments** — Kills discussion and reputation
2. **Only promoting, never helping** — Community notices
3. **Generic comments** — "Great post!" adds nothing
4. **Ignoring others' posts** — Engagement is reciprocal

### Strategy Mistakes
1. **Expecting instant results** — This takes months
2. **Treating it as a launch platform** — It's a community, not Product Hunt
3. **Inconsistent posting** — Regular rhythm builds following
4. **Not tracking results** — Use UTMs to measure impact

---

## Integration with Other Channels

### IH + Twitter Strategy
- Cross-post major milestones to both platforms
- Use Twitter for daily engagement, IH for weekly deep-dives
- Link Twitter in IH posts for followers who want more frequent updates

### IH + Reddit Strategy
- IH is more promotion-friendly than Reddit
- Use Reddit insights as content for IH posts
- "I learned this talking to r/[SUBREDDIT] users..."

### IH + Product Hunt Strategy
- Build IH audience before PH launch
- IH followers can support your PH launch
- Share PH results on IH afterward
